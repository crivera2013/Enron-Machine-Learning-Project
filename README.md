# Enron-Machine-Learning-Project
Designing machine learning algorithms
This project for udacity was to create a machine learning algorithm that analyzed Enron financial and email data to predict persons of interest in the Enron fraud case.
This code includes:

1. cleaning the data.
2. designing new metrics.
3. implementing different machine learning algorithms.
4. cross validation of the data set.
5. regularization of the machine learning algorithm to prevent overfitting.
6. Precision and recall.
